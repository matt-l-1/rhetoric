<h1>Rhetoric and Political Prose: What do politicians say?</h1>
<p>
    By <i>Matthew Lee</i>
</p>

<p>
   Politicians are known for their speeches. It is their modus operandi for communicating with the public. Although that may have changed in recent years with the exponential growth of social media, it is undeniable that delivering speeches is a central tenant of life as a politician - or at the least a successful one.
</p>
<p>
    So... what do politicians actually say in these speeches?

<p>
This takes an aggregate view. It lumps all politicians together. It reminds me of the famous the phrase "all politicians are the same".
</p>
<p>
     We have all heard it. But is it really true?

    Rhetoric Across Party

<p>
    This graph shows that pretty much no matter the party, they are all saying the same. Or at the very least, using the same words. Is this a surprise? Would we not expect all politicians to say the same things. After all, they <i>are</i> all talking about... well... politics.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the differences make sense too.
</p>
<p>
    Conservatives disproportionately use the word "Government" relatively little. But that would make sense. Since the Conservative Party were formed in 1834, they have been in majority rule for over 100 years. And outside the Houses of Parliament, we scarcely hear the phrase "this Government". They are much more likely to say "Conservatives" to promote the party.

    Rhetoric Across Time

<p>
    If there is little difference across party, what about across time?

    What these visuals most clearly demonstrate to me is the change of audience. Before 1945, "Here, here", "Cheer" "Common", "House" features commonly. The data most likely comes from Hansard as historically this would have been the only accurate record of what politicians had said (as speeches would have not been recorded). A good example of this is Churchill's "We shall fight them on the beaches" speech which was originally delivered to the Commons. The speech was only later recorded in 1949.
    
In modern politics, the electorate is most certainly the audience. Apart from the prison population, suffrage has extended to almost all adults in the UK, as such outside of Select Committees and other esoteric parliamentary functions, the language is directed at the public, especially debates like Prime Minister's Questions.
</p>
<p>
Politicians are quite open about this. Boris Johnson famously used words of Anglo-Saxon origin as they are more palatable to the electorate than those from Romance languages. His time in office was hallmarked by three-word-phrases.
    
Get Brexit Done.
    
Hands. Face. Space.
    
Take back control.
    
And from Tony Blair, the simple:
    
Education. Education. Education.
    
To assess this, I think it interesting to analyse the length of the words politicians are using.

<p>
But is that not the opposite of what we would expect?
    
These slogans "Hands. Face. Space." are mostly publicised on social media and only in a speech for a soundbite. As time has passed, the speech has moved away from being the only vessel for politicians to communicate with, it is now just one of many ways to vocalise their message. I think the increase in word length in speeches can be attributed to this becoming the "long-form" method of communication.
    
I think it may also be useful to look at the length of these speeches over time.

<p>
    There appears to be an overall fall in speech length here. Maybe there is no rhyme or reason. This will require more detailed analysis. For this reason, I have began more rigorous analysis of the words specifically used. Details below.

Semantic analysis can be found <a href="https://hackmd.io/G-W58pvQQtWVMGvtB9xoNA">here</a>. This has an introduction to using the Python Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for semantic analysis. This can be used for example for comparing language to a political timeline, e.g., do we see more reference to education during the Blair Government, more reference to monetary policy during the Thatcher and Brown Governments.
